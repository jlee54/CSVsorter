Project Description: CSV sorter (by first and last name) as a skills testing project for Unabridged Software.


Finally was able to get to this after a week of midterms :(
I wrote this under the assumption using libraries was okay. 
Took 3.5 hours to complete (including research and planning)

The program can be run with specified program arguements (prefix with ruby on unix command line):
eg. Test_Input/MOCK_DATA_BLANK_FIELDS.csv Output/SortByLastName.csv Output/SortByFirstName.csv

Or specified by the user in the console during execution. 
eg.  
Test_Input/MOCK_DATA_BLANK_FIELDS.csv
Output/SortByLastName.csv
Output/SortByFirstName.csv

If you want to read and write to the same file
eg. Test_Input/MOCK_DATA.csv Test_Input/MOCK_DATA.csv Test_Input/MOCK_DATA.csv
